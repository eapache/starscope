Starscope is a code indexer, search and navigation tool for
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), [Golang](https://golang.org/), and
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) with a design intended
to make it easy to add [support for other languages](doc/LANGUAGE_SUPPORT.md).

Inspired by the extremely popular [Ctags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags)
and [Cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net/) utilities, Starscope can answer a
lot of questions about your code. It can tell you:
 - where methods are defined
 - where methods are called
 - where variables are assigned
 - where symbols are used
 - where files and libraries are imported or required

While Ctags already supports many languages, it can only tell you where things
are defined. Cscope can answer a lot more of your questions, but it is limited
to just the C language family. Starscope was written to combine the power of
Cscope with the flexibility of Ctags, bringing full code indexing to as many
developers as possible.

Quick Start
-----------

Install it as a gem:
```
$ gem install starscope
```

Build your database by just running it in the project directory:
```
$ cd ~/my-project
$ starscope
```

Ask it things directly:
```
$ starscope -q calls,new # Lists all callers of new
```

Export it to various existing formats for automatic integration with your editor:
```
$ starscope -e ctags
$ starscope -e cscope
```
